        "description": "13 Year Straight Rye Whiskey finished in Calvados Casks in honor of our celebrity pet pig, Mauve’s undying love of apples.<br/>The result is extraordinary. A unique blend of sweet and spiced flavors with a fine balance between American power and French sophistication. There’s nothing else like it.",
        "tastingNotes": "NOSE: Mulled cider, cardamom, candied ginger and a touch of piper tobacco. Caramel, vanilla and gentle Rye spice develops with time in the glass.<br/>PALATE: Maple syrup and pears are balanced by dark chocolate and French oak spice. With water, the spice moves front and center and a vibrant, fruit-forward character develops.<br/>FINISH: Lasting spice and a touch of charred oak and caramel, maple syrup lingers as the finish fades.",
