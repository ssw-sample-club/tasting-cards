        "description": "Inspired by the first recorded circumnavigation of the globe, The Boss Hog VII: Magellan’s Atlantic is a Straight Rye Whiskey with an uncharted cask journey that stretches across continents. After seventeen years of slumber in American Oak, it first encounters new Spanish staves from the mountainous forests of northern Spain; a cask nearly impossible to tame yet well worth the effort. Crossing the Atlantic the whiskey finds its finish in fragrant South American teakwood.",
        "tastingNotes": "NOSE: Intensely aromatic, with cinnamon sugar, allspice, and maple. With time, toasted wood notes arise alongside creamy vanilla, roasted almonds, and a touch of ground espresso.<br/>PALATE: Spicy cloves and sweet brandied cherries abound, with baking spices rampant. A closer look reveals subtle hints of charred oak, sage, and dark chocolate.<br/>FINISH: Everlasting; gobs of cinnamon, oak spice, and a gentle warmth demand another sip.",
