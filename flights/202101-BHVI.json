        "description": "The Boss Hog Edition 六 is the first American Whiskey finished using Japanese Umeshu, the result of a true collaboration between WhistlePig and Kitaya brewery on Japan’s Kyushu island.<br/>This well aged Straight Rye Whiskey was created using koji fermentation.  Each bottle is adorned with The Samurai Scientist – Jōkichi Takamine – who pioneered koji fermentation in the American whisky industry over a century ago.",
        "tastingNotes": "NOSE: Intensely aromatic, with cinnamon, maple, and toasted marshmallow that develops with time in the glass.<br/>PALATE: Tobacco, ginger, baking spices, and savory umami creating a remarkably rich, nuanced and elegant profile lending to soft, sweet notes that further color the mosaic of flavor.<br/>FINISH: Incredibly long, with oak spice, char, and just a touch of smoke lingers as the finish fades.",
